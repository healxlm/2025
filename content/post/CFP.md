# Call for Papers
Recent advancements in generative AI have paved the way for powerful Language Model techniques to be applied in
health-related contexts, offering potential benefits for healthcare providers and patients. These models can support
medical professionals by aiding diagnosis, treatment planning, and process optimisation, offering patients more
accessible and immediate guidance. However, several challenges must be addressed to ensure safe and effective
use. Key issues include the accuracy and reliability of medical information, as any misinformation could have serious
consequences. Additionally, protecting patient privacy and data security is a priority, as sensitive health data must
be handled according to the reference regulations. Addressing biases in AI-generated responses is another critical
concern, as ensuring that sensitive topics, such as mental health or end-of-life care, are approached with empathy
and professionalism. Moreover, for AI models to be truly effective in clinical settings, They must be integrated
with existing healthcare systems and continuously updated to reflect the latest medical knowledge and guidelines.
While much discussion surrounds the application of Language models in healthcare, their integration into clinical
practice is complex and unresolved. The **Healthcare Empowerment and Advancement Leveraging xLM (HEALxLM)**  will, therefore, explore these challenges and potential solutions
for advancing language models, both small and large (xLM), for applications in healthcare.

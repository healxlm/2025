      <description>Call for Papers Recent advancements in generative AI have paved the way for powerful Language Model techniques to be applied in health-related contexts, offering potential benefits for healthcare providers and patients. These models can support medical professionals by aiding diagnosis, treatment planning, and process optimisation, offering patients more accessible and immediate guidance. However, several challenges must be addressed to ensure safe and effective use. Key issues include the accuracy and reliability of medical information, as any misinformation could have serious consequences.</description>

              Recent trends in computer science have promoted new ways to think about software at both design time and run
              time. Next-generation intelligent pervasive systems will be modelled as ecosystems of Digital Twins (DTs), that are
              the virtual counterparts of physical objects. Digital Twins have emerged as a revolutionary approach to managing
              and optimising the lifecycle of physical assets in pervasive computing applications. By creating a digital counterpart, that mirrors a physical entity or
              process and encapsulates computational intelligence or simulation tools, stakeholders can continuously monitor,
              analyse, and predict the behaviour of the real-world counterpart in real time. This continuous feedback loop
              enables enhanced decision-making, efficiency improvements, and proactive maintenance, thereby driving innovation
              and competitiveness in various industries. In particular, the convergence of IoT, AI, and big data analytics has
              accelerated the development and adoption of DTs in several application domains. IoT devices provide the necessary
              sensory input, AI offers advanced data processing, reasoning and decision-making capabilities, and big data analytics
              facilitates the handling of large volumes of data generated by physical and digital entities. Moreover, different
              simulation techniques are exploited in this context, being complementary approaches that can be integrated as
              tools with analytics and predictive properties. This synergy is critical in realising the full potential of Digital
              Twins, making it possible to create highly responsive, intelligent, and autonomous systems. As such, they are
              becoming increasingly vital in a wide range of sectors, from manufacturing to the energy industry, healthcare, and
              transportation.

            <p>Rarely we can think of assets as fully isolated from their surroundings. This is especially true when we start
              applying the DT concept not only to devices or products but possibly to people and processes we want to track in
              our domain. Following this trend, Digital Twins Ecosystems can be envisioned to not be limited to the scope of
              an individual twin but to engineer the integration of several DTs to get a holistic view of the target domain.
              However, the design and implementation of Digital Twin Ecosystems are not without challenges. Issues such
              as data security, privacy, and ethical considerations are paramount, especially given the sensitive nature of the data
              involved. Ensuring interoperability and scalability of Digital Twin solutions across different platforms and industries
              also presents significant hurdles. Integrating and coordinating different approaches to analyse the whole ecosystem
              behaviour and possibly predict its evolution is another open issue. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted
              effort from the research community and industry practitioners.</p>
